This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code improvements

Below are the things I would do to improve the following code base:

1. **Proper project setup and modularization**:

   - Organize the project into specific folders with clearly defined roles.
   - Example folder structure:
     - `utils/`: For utility functions.
     - `theme/`: For theming engine and setup.
     - `components/`: For reusable components across the application.

2. **Proper error handling and feedback**:

   - Implement loading states and error messages to improve user experience.

3. **Performance optimization**:
   - Techniques such as code splitting, memoization, and lazy loading to enhance performance.
