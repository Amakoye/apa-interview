This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code improvements

Below are the things I would do to improve the following code base:
1: Proper project setup and modularising it further, each folder have a specific role, for instance utils for all my utility funcions, theme for theming engine and setup, components for reusable components accros the application, etc. 2. Proper Error handling and feedback, that is showing loading states and error messages when necessary. 3. Perfomance optimization, with methods including but not limited to Code splitting, memoization and lazy loading
